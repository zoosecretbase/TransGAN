    "## **Paper Summary**\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "TransGAN is a transformer-based GAN model which can be considered as a pilot study as being completely free of convolutions. The architecture of TransGAN mainly consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a patch-level discriminator that is also transformer-based. In training of the model, a series of techniques are combined in the original paper such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding to overcome the general training instability issues of the GAN. We implemented data augmentation [(Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf), and relative position encoding in our work. In the original paper, performance of the model tested on different datasets such as STL-10, CIFAR-10, CelebA datasets and achieved competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutions. In our project, we only tested our implementation on CIFAR10 dataset as we stated in our experimental result goals.\n",

    "### **Transformer Encoder as Basic Block**\n",
    "We used the transformer encoder [(Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) as our basic block as in the original paper. An encoder is a composition of two parts. The first part is constructed by a multi-head self-attention module and the second part is a feed-forward MLP with GELU non-linearity. We apply layer normalization [(Ba et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450.pdf) before both of the two parts.Both parts employ residual connection.\n",

    "### **Memory-friendly Generator**\n",
    "In building the memory-friendly generator, TransGAN utilizes a common design philosophy in CNN-based GANs which iteratively upscale the resolution at multiple stages. Figure 1 (left) illustrates the memory-friendly generator which consists of multiple stages with several transformer blocks. At each stage, feature map resolution is gradually increased until it meets the target resolution *H × W*. The generator takes the random noise input and passes it through a multiple-layer perceptron (MLP). The output vector reshaped into a $H_0 × W_0$ resolution feature map (by default $H_0$ = $W_0$ = 8), each point a C-dimensional embedding.  This “feature map\" is next treated as a length-64 sequence of C-dimensional tokens, combined with the learnable positional encoding. \n",
    "Then, transformer encoders take embedding tokens as inputs and calculate the correspondence between each token recursively. To synthesize higher resolution images, we insert an upsampling module after each stage, consisting of a pixelshuffle [(Shi et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158.pdf) module. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tokenized-input for Discriminator**\n",
    "The authors design the discriminator as shown in Figure 1 (right) that it takes the patches of an image as inputs. Then, they split the input images $Y$ ∈ $R^{H×W×3}$ into 8x8 patches where each patch can be regarded as a \"word\". The patches are then converted to the 1D sequence of token embeddings through a linear flatten layer. After that, learnable position encoding is added, and tokens pass through the transformer encoder. Finally, tokens are taken by the classification head to output the real/fake prediction.    "

We had decided not to implement 'Co-Training with Self-Supervised Auxiliary Task' and 'Locality-Aware Initialization for Self-Attention' since they made only small differences as shown in the paper. The difference between our result and original paper result can be originated in using some different hyperparameters and abovementioned implementation differences. You can see our quantitative result, FID score 26.82, [here](https://github.com/asarigun/TransGAN/blob/main/results/wgangp_eps_optim_Adam_lr_gen_0_0001_lr_dis_0_0001_epoch_200.txt).\n",

    "## Challenges and Discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the authors did not give detailed hyperparameters for each Transformers Block and Multi-Head Attention Mechanism on version 1, we needed to find the best hyperparameters. Also, in the training part, they did not give detailed hyperparameters such as droprate, weight decay, or batch normalization in version 1. But in the last version of the original paper, authors gave more detailed hyperparameters for training, therefore we got more reasonable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the implementation, first we used Hinge loss and faced convergence problem in training. When we tried another loss function, WGAN-GP, that is mentioned in the last version of original paper, we achieved to overcome convergence problem and got better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As authors didn't share detailed training process in their previous version, we struggled to converge FID score during training. But in the latest version of the original paper, authors provided more details for training so that we achieved to converge FID score in the training.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to lack of computational resource, we only trained the largest model, TransGAN-XL in our project. We implemented data augmentation in our model as it is considered crucial for TransGAN in the original paper. We didn't implement 'Co-Training with Self-Supervised Auxiliary Task' and 'Locality-Aware Initialization for Self-Attention' since they make only small differences as shown in the paper."
